[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/seatgeek/sixpack-java.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/seatgeek/sixpack-java) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/seatgeek/sixpack-java/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github&t=rRY7ax)](https://coveralls.io/github/seatgeek/sixpack-java?branch=master)

A Java client for SeatGeek's Sixpack a/b testing framework: https://github.com/seatgeek/sixpack

### Installing

Sixpack-java is currently only being deployed to maven snapshots, to use it, add the following dependency to your build.gradle:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots' }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.seatgeek:sixpack-java:0.4-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

or, if you're a maven user:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.seatgeek</groupId>
  <artifactId>sixpack-java</artifactId>
  <version>0.4-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

### Overview

The Sixpack client has some nomenclature to be familiar with...

- A _Sixpack server_ is the deployment of the [Sixpack-server](https://github.com/seatgeek/sixpack)
    that will be hosting your test results
- An _experiment_ represents a single test in the _Sixpack server_. It can have multiple _alternatives_
- An _alternative_ is one potential result returned to the client when _participating_ in an _experiment_
- You start a test by _participating_ in an _experiment_ with _alternatives_
- Once the server has selected an _alternative_ for you, you can _convert_ the _experiment_ when the user
    performs the action that you're measuring

### Getting Started

After [installing](#installing)...

The first thing to do is create a `Sixpack` client using the `SixpackBuilder`:

```java
    Sixpack sixpack = new SixpackBuilder()
            .setSixpackUrl("http://api.mycompany.com/sixpack")
            .setClientId(user != null ? user.sixpackId : getCachedClientId())
            .build();
```

It is recommended that you maintain a singleton instance of `Sixpack` with the DI library of your choice.

### Creating Experiments

0. Create a new experiment from your `Sixpack` instance:

    ```java
        Experiment colorsExperiment = Sixpack.experiment()
                .withName("colors")
               Â .withAlternatives(
                    new Alternative("control"),
                    new Alternative("red"),
                    new Alternative("green"),
                    new Alternative("blue")
                )
                .build();
    ```
0. Participate in that new `Experiment` by calling `participate()`

    ```java
        ParticipatingExperiment participatingExperiment = colorsExperiment.participate();
    ```
0. When the user performs the action measured in the test, convert the experiment

    ```java
        participatingExperiment.convert();
    ```
